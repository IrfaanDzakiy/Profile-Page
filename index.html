				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<p>Hello!. My name is M. Irfaan Dzakiy. My friends usually call me Irfaan or Fa'an. I was born in Palembang, 11th September 2001. I'm currently studying at Institut Teknologi Bandung majoring at School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. I make this portofolio website as one of the requirement to apply for CSLeaders scholarship program. To be honest, i never learn how to make a website before. I have to do research about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and then making the actual website in a span of three days. It is a bit chalengging at first, but fortunately i managed to finish it on time. So, here are some information about myself!!!

				<h1>MY MOTIVATION</h1>
				<p>There are many reasons why i wanted to join the CSLeaders program. One of them is i see the opportunity to improve my self as an individual. CSLeaders has the programs and tools to train and develop a true leader that not only has great softskill and hardskill, but also has great innovation and creativity. I wanted to develop myself because i don't want to be a regular collage student that only study at class. I want to expand my knowledge, my connection, my perspective so that i can become the person that make this country better in the future, which is my other reason why i wanted to join CSLeaders. Student from the School of Electrical Engineering typically work at an office for most of their life. I don't want to be like that. I don't want to spend the rest of my life working in an office. I want to make a difference for this country. I want to use the knowledge that i hopefully get from this program to tackle and solve problems that the society has, and create a positive impact for the local community.
